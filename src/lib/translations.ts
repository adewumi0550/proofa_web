        faq_q2: "How does the verification work?",
        faq_a2: "The platform utilizes proprietary logic to audit your workflow. By analyzing the sequence of your creative decisions, the system generates a score that confirms human-led authorship over automated generation.",

        faq_q4: "Is my creative process private?",
        faq_a4: "Yes. Your workflow data is stored on a secure, private ledger. This allows you to maintain a permanent record of your authorship without exposing your work or your prompts to the public.",
        faq_q5: "What does 'Future Licensing' mean?",

        faq_q2: "Wie funktioniert die Verifikation?",
        faq_a2: "Die Plattform nutzt eine proprietäre Logik, um Ihren Workflow zu prüfen. Durch die Analyse der Abfolge Ihrer kreativen Entscheidungen generiert das System eine Punktzahl, die die menschliche Urheberschaft über die automatisierte Generierung bestätigt.",
        faq_q3: "Welche Modelle werden im Arbeitsbereich unterstützt?",
        faq_a3: "Die Umgebung ermöglicht es Ihnen, verschiedene professionelle Modelle zu orchestrieren. Unsere Logik ist modellunabhängig; sie überwacht die Interaktion des Erstellers mit den Werkzeugen, nicht die Werkzeuge selbst.",
        faq_q4: "Ist mein kreativer Prozess privat?",
        faq_a4: "Ja. Ihre Workflow-Daten werden in einem sicheren, privaten Register gespeichert. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, eine dauerhafte Aufzeichnung Ihrer Urheberschaft zu führen, ohne Ihre Arbeit oder Ihre Prompts der Öffentlichkeit preiszugeben.",
        faq_q5: "Was bedeutet 'Zukünftige Lizenzierung'?",
        faq_a5: "Die Sicherung eines Passes schafft heute eine grundlegende Aufzeichnung Ihrer Urheberschaft. Dieser technische Beweis soll die Grundlage für die zukünftige Vermögensverwaltung und kommerzielle Nutzung in unserem sich entwickelnden Ökosystem bilden.",
